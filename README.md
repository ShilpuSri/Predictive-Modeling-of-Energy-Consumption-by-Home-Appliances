# Predictive-Modeling-of-Energy-Consumption-by-Home-Appliances

The demand for energy resources has been growing
exponentially and an estimation of the energy consumption at
the consumer level has become essential in terms of forecast
and efficient planning of energy resources. Buildings contribute
significantly to the consumption of energy and hence it is crucial
to take appropriate measures to control the energy consumed
by home appliances. The paper aims to perform a data-driven
prediction of the energy usage of appliances in a low-energy
house.The data used for the prediction comprises the energy use
of the light fixtures and the temperature and humidity in all
the rooms of the house. Some of the weather parameters of a
nearby weather station, for instance, the wind speed, visibility,
and dew-point temperature are also taken into consideration.
The paper aims at building predictive models based on the
machine learning algorithms, one from each of the (a) linear, (b)
tree-based, (c) distance-based, (d) rule-based and (e) ensemble
categories followed by an evaluation of the performance. Feature
engineering has been deployed on the data set for filtering and
eliminating the non-predictive parameters in order to exacerbate
the accuracy and performance of the models. Based on the highest
R-squared value and minimum Root Mean Square Error, the
Random Forest regression model seems to yield the most optimal
results. The the potential outlier entries in the data set are also
identified using five different outlier detecting techniques and the
entries that have been detected by a minimum of three or more
methods are declared as outliers.
